  # This workflow has access to github secrets and a token with write permissions,
  # so that we can _write_ a comment on the PR with the link_checker's output.
  #
  # In theory, someone could make a malicious change to the workflow file or
  # the link_checker script, and we'd run that code during this workflow. There's
  # not much at stake though, since this repo doesn't contain any secrets or costly
  # deployment process. The alternative is to run this workflow in a read only context
  # using the `pull_request` event, save the report as an artifact, then use a
  # separate workflow to download the artifact and post it as a comment. That
  # approach still has the issue of running unreviewed code changes to the
  # link_checker or the workflow, but it wouldn't expose any github secrets to
  # that job. There's no secrets in this repo so the risk of someone attacking
  # this repo with a "pwn request" is low.
